1) Real World Example that requires sorting:
	LTB / Linear in general, any application involving information retrieval
2) Other measures of efficiency:
	Cost, Time to Market
3) Data Structures:
	Hash Table, o(1) lookup for first element.  With collisions, tables can be complicated and slower.  Unsorted, poor for finding intersections, min, maxes, etc.
4) How is shortest path and travelling salesman similar/diff:
	They both involve minimizing a traversal, but shortest path is a to b.  Travelling salesman is a to b to n to a.  Also an efficient solution exists for shortest path.
5)
  A) Real world problem where only best solution:
    A system where people's lives are at stake, such as auto pilot software.
  B: Approximate solution:
    Driving directions
